# SedgwickLabMeeting
Commons for sharing papers &amp; code for the ETHZ Plant Ecology Group's remote lab meeting.

We, remote outpost of the Plant Ecology Group, host a semi-weekly, informal lab meeting to discuss all things coexistence. This repo is a commons to share the schedule, code, and notes for and from these meetings.

## Meeting details
Wednesdays @ 16:30 (usually)
Tipton House, UCNRS Sedgwick Reserve

## Schedule
### 9 May 2018
Our goal is to reproduce the coexistence analysis in Fig. 2 of Krafyt et al. (2015), and to discuss how functional trait variation affects coexistence in the Sedgwick annual plants.
