## Goal:

Reproduce Fig. 2 of Kraft et al. (2015):
```{r goal,fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Goal-Kraft2015_Fig2.png")
```

In so doing, we'll explore open science tools that may intrest the group. FigShare, Git(Hub), RMarkdown, & pipeline workflows in code.

## 0. Preliminaries

We're going to highlight a few packages that are helpful when wrangling and plotting data. Load them:
```{r prelims,message=FALSE}
library(readr)  # clean data importing
library(dplyr)  # data wrangling & pipeline tools
library(tidyr)  # data wrangling tools
library(ggplot2)  # easy publication quality plots
```
Using versions:
```{r}
installed.packages()[names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs), "Version"]
``` 

Object naming conventions:

- `variables` will be descriptive nouns written in snake_case
- `functions` will be descriptive verbs written in camelCase

- ggplot [Reference](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

## 1. Import the data from online archives.

The demographic rates for Kraft et al.'s (2015; hereafter 'Kraft') coexistence analysis were originally published in Appendix Table 3 by Godoy et al. (2014). The data were republished by Godoy et al. (2017) in a FigShare archive along with the competition coefficients. We'll use the machine-readible FigShare versions for both.

```{r importdata}
demog <- "IMPORT FROM URL"

alphas <- "IMPORT FROM URL"

```

## 2. The ingredients: Niche and fitness differences
### 2.1. Making the background
Modern coexistence theory (Chesson 2000; summarized in Kraft) details the condition for pairwise coexistence:

$$
\rho<\frac{\kappa_j}{\kappa_i}<\frac{1}{\rho},
$$

where $\rho$ is the pairwise niche overlap (its complement, $1-\rho$, is the pairwise niche difference) and $\kappa_i/\kappa_j$ is the average fitness difference between species $i$ and $j$. If we arbitrarily assign species $j$ as the superior competitor, this reduces to:
$$
\rho<\frac{\kappa_i}{\kappa_j}.
$$
Note that the subscripts on the kappas have flipped.

In the Sedgwick annual plant community, Kraft estimated these by fitting experimental data to a model of annual plant population dynamics with pairwise, Beverton-Holt competition terms.

We'll begin by making the figure background to show which fitness differences (y-axis) are compatable with coexistence for each value of niche difference (x-axis). `ggplot` constructs plots as layers, and this is exactly how we'll reproduce Kraft Fig. 2.

```{r figbackground}
## Make a data.frame that holds the maximum fitness difference where
## the pair may coexist


## Plot it


```

### 2.2. Calculate all pairwise niche and fitness differences

Kraft calculated the pairwise niche overlap for annual plants as:

$$
\rho=\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_{ij}\alpha_{ji}}{\alpha_{jj}\alpha_{ii}}},
$$
where $\alpha_{ji}$ is the per-capita effect of species $j$ on the fitness of species $i$.

We can calculate this quantity for each species pair using the data in the `alphas` matrix as follows:

```{r rho}

```

Kraft calculated the average fitness difference for each species pair as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\kappa_j}{\kappa_i} &= \left(\frac{\eta_j-1}{\eta_i-1}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_{ij}\alpha_{ii}}{\alpha_{jj}\alpha_{ji}}} \\
&= \left(\frac{\frac{g_j\lambda_j}{1-(1-g_j)(s_j)}-1}{\frac{g_i\lambda_i}{1-(1-g_i)(s_i)}-1}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_{ij}\alpha_{ii}}{\alpha_{jj}\alpha_{ji}}},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $g$ is the germination fraction, $\lambda$ is the per-capita seed production of plants in the absence of competitors, and $s_i$ is the annual survival rate of ungerminated seeds in the soil seedbank.

As before, we can calculate this quantity for all species pairs using the `alphas` matrix and the `demog` data frame.

```{r kappas}

```

## 3. Coexistence analysis & plot

Finally, we'll put this all together as a new layer in the plot.
